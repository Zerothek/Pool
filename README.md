POOL

This is a classic version of the 8 Ball Pool game.
In order to switch from the Top perspective to the "Cue Perspective" you
have to press the spacebar button.
In order to rotate the scene around the ball on the horizontal axis you
gave to press and hold the right mouse button and to move the mouse in
the desired direction.
To shoot you will have to press and hold the left mouse button and an 
animation of the cue going back and forth will start.The power of the
shot will be proportional with the distance between the cue and the white
ball.
After you shoot the perspective of the camera will change to a Top View
in order to see the balls better.
In the console informations about the current player(1 or 2) will be 
displayed(the number of fouls committed and the number of balls potted).
When you commit a foul(or when the game starts) you can move the white
ball with the WASD keys.

In order to play the game you have to open Framework_EGC.sln(which is located
in the Visual Studio folder) and compile the program.The sources are located
in the Source/Pool folder.
